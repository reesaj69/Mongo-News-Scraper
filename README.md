# Mongo-News-Scraper
 
Mongo-News-Scraper is an app that scrapes stories from the New York Times and display them for the user. Each scraped article

is saved to an application database. At a minimum, the app scrapes and displays the following information for each article:

     * The title of the article

     * The URL to the original article
     
     * It allows the user to leave comments on the article displayed and revisit them later.  The comments are saved to the 
       database as well.
       
     * Users are also able to delete comments left on the articles
