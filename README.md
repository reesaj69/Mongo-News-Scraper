# Mongo-News-Scraper
 
Mongo-News-Scraper is an app that scrapes stories from the New York Times and display them for the user. Each scraped article
is saved to an application database. At a minimum, the app scrapes and displays the following information for each article:
the title of the article, the URL to the original article, and user's comments.  Comments are saved to a database and can be deleted by the user.
